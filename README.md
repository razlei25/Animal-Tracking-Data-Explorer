# Mouse Tracking Data Visualizer
**A no-code, user-friendly software for exploring animal tracking data.**

## :dizzy: Motivation

Animal movement tracking is a foundational to behavioral neuroscience research. At [Forkosh Lab](https://www.forkoshlab.com/), we use the social box - a seminatural setup for automatic and prolonged monitoring of mouse group dynamics (read more below).

This is an original setup that was developed by a group of researchers (up-to-date setup as described in [Forkosh et al., 2019](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.forkoshlab.com/_files/ugd/294655_eb32afe955b245d997b2a35a5f4b29e2.pdf)) and has been used in our lab as the standard framework for running our experiments.

The datasets resulting from these filmed experiments (after initial processing of video, including application of tags to the frames, etc.) are rich but may be difficult to analyze for someone who's unfamiliar with their structure or with coding. Additionally, even researchers who are familiar with it may occasionally need to run a few quick checks to get an idea of the results before and while diving in to their analyses. Therefore it can be handy to have a tool that allows users to run quick calculations and visualizations of their data, without having to dirty their hands with long scripts of code.


## :mouse2: Social Box Setup (example data)
In our experiments, we used groups of four mice, that were marked with dyes of four different colors for identification purposes. The mice were housed in an enriched semi-naturalistic environment where they could move and interact freely over multiple days. Each arena contained a closed nest, two feeders, two water bottles, two ramps, an open shelter, and an S-shaped separation wall in the center.
