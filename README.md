# Mouse Tracking Data Visualizer
A no-code, user-friendly software for exploring mouse tracking data from the the CheeseCube setup used at [Forkosh Lab](https://www.forkoshlab.com/).
## Motivation
Movement tracking is a popular method in behavioral neuroscience in animals today. At Forkosh Lab, we use an original setup, nicknamed the CheeseCube, which simulates a naturalistic environment, where we run experiments on mice.

Tracking videos are data-heavy and after being tagged, can be used for various tests.

To get familiar with the data before diving into research, a student may want to explore the data first. This program aims to ease this intial step by providing quick fundumnetal calculations and visualizations, accesible even to a student with no coding background.
